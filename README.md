## SHAP Explainability & Detailed Feature Impact

The app provides a SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) waterfall plot to visually explain how each health metric (feature) contributed to your diabetes risk prediction. Below the plot, a detailed explanation is provided for each feature, describing:
- The value you entered
- Whether it increased, decreased, or did not affect your risk
- A plain-language summary of the impact

This helps you understand not just the overall result, but also which factors are most important for your personal risk profile.

## üóÇÔ∏è Explore More Dataset Insights

This section of the app provides interactive, collapsible visualizations to help you understand the dataset and your risk in context:

- **üßÆ Risk Group Distribution:** See how many people in the dataset are diabetic vs. non-diabetic, with an explanation of why this matters.
- **üìà Average Glucose by Age Group:** Explore how average glucose levels and group sizes change across age groups, with a combined bar/line chart and plain-language insights.
- **‚öñÔ∏è BMI Category Breakdown:** View the distribution of BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese) and learn why this is important for diabetes risk.

Each visualization is in its own dropdown (expander) for a clean, user-friendly experience. Explanations and practical takeaways are provided for every chart.
